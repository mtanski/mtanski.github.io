I have a love and hate relationship with Rust. I love the intellectual premise of Rust; the promise of C/C++ bare metal performance with safety provided managed languages with managed run times. Using the language for building a complex project is an exercise in frustration. Not a kind of rewarding frustration you feel when you're learning and growing, but the kind of frustration where you want to hurt yourself or yell at developers of the language.

I've been following Rust for 4+ years and trying and failing to use in my use cases for 2+ years. The premise is compelling enough that I keep coming back. The frustration is great enough that I keep leaving.
